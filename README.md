PROJECT: CODE CHALLENGES
This project contains solutions to three code challenges that test programming skills in various areas.



CHALLENGE 1: Student Grade Generator

Description
This program prompts the user to input student marks between 0 and 100 and outputs the corresponding grade:

A > 79
B - 60 to 79
C - 59 to 49
D - 40 to 49
E - less than 40

Usage
To run the program, simply execute the Challenge.html file and follow the prompts.



CHALLENGE 2: Speed Detector

Description
This program takes as input the speed of a car and calculates the demerit points for the driver according to the following rules:

If the speed is less than 70, it prints "Ok".
For every 5 km/h above the speed limit (70), it gives the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points.
If the driver gets more than 12 points, the program prints "License suspended".

Usage
To run the program, execute the Challenge.html  file and enter the speed of the car when prompted.



CHALLENGE 3: Net Salary Calculator

Description
This program calculates an individual's net salary based on their basic salary and benefits. It calculates the following:

Payee (tax)
NHIF Deductions
NSSF Deductions
Gross Salary
Net Salary

Usage
To run the program, execute the Challenge.html  file and enter the required inputs when prompted.

Conclusion
These code challenges are designed to help in human services in the government and academic fields
